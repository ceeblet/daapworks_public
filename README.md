daapWorks2004
=============

This is a project I did for the University of Cincinnati in 2004. 
It started out as an online database where Art, Architecture and Design 
seniors who were participating in the senior exhibit could enter their 
data and pictures for the exhibit program (book). I decided to do an interactive 
interface to display the data dynamically from the database.

Because of University logistics I couldn't access the database directly in real time so I would get
regular exports of the data in xml format. I parsed the xml files to retrieve
the data for display.

Since the students were updating their project data often the dynamic nature 
of this interface worked well. I was able to display more up-to-date information
than the published exhibit book due to publication deadlines.

I was also created a CD version of the interface that was mass produced and
included in the graduation packet for the students.

I did both the design and the programming using actionScript in Flash (javascript). All movement in the design was done programmatically with code (no keyframes or timeline editing).
I also did the cover and booklet mockups for printing.
